# EE224-course-project
This is a course project for the Digital Systems course in sem 3.

The main task was to replicate the i281 CPU made by Prof. Alexander Stoytchev from Iowa State University.

#Problem Statement
Design and implement a simplified CPU capable of executing a bubble sort algorithm. Your processor should be able to read an unsorted array from memory, sort it, and write the sorted result back to memory.
It was done in a team of 3. Everything is done in Verilog and a thorough report is also made and added to the repo!

Main problem statement was for a single cycle implementation of the CPU, and we have also done a bonus task of making it multi-cycle implementation!
The report is kinda lacking for the multi-cycle implementation of the CPU, it was due to the time constraints of the project!

Use the Verilog codes in Quartus Software along with ModelSim for verifying the waveforms of the Bubble Sort from the report!
